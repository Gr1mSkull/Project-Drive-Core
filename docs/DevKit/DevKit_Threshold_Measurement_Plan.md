## 1. General requirements

### 1.1 DUT baseline (ADR-015)

Each session shall record:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Composite baseline ID | ADR-015 / STD-REV-001 |
| Logic BOARD_ID | TBD-DK-020 map when available |
| Power BOARD_ID | As wired |
| Firmware build ID | Certification build per ADR-018 when available |
| Config profile hash | `devkit.yaml` compile ID |
| Analysis package version | WP-009 doc revision |

### 1.2 Instrument capability (no MPN selection)

| Capability | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| Oscilloscope bandwidth | ≥ required edge bandwidth for fastest expected transition (study: ≥20 MHz for switch edges; **verify against final DUT**) |
| Sample rate | Sufficient for ≤10 % timing uncertainty on smallest budget term |
| Current probe range | Above expected peak including fault tests |
| Isolation | Isolated or differential where ground reference differs |
| Time sync | Common timebase or documented skew correction between channels |
| DMM | Bench PSU monitoring; rail checks |

### 1.3 Conservative acceptance structure

```text
approved_limit ≥ t_worst_or_I_worst + uncertainty + margin
```

Minimum repetitions for timing: **≥30** captures per configuration unless hazard limits lower count (document if reduced).

Statistics: report **maximum observed**, mean, σ, outliers removed with justification.

## 2. Current measurements
