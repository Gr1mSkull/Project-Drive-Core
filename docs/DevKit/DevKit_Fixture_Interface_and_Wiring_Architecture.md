No connector families or pinouts are selected.

## 2. Wiring evaluation classes (§26)

| Class | Functional purpose | Energy class | Separation needs | Routing constraints | Observation requirements | Fault consequences | Required inputs (I/V/thermal) | Connector evaluation inputs | Detailed-design blockers |
|-------|--------------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| `W-FX-POWER-BASE` | Base hazardous energy | Hazardous (base) | From signal/safety | Short, defined return | Entry/channel MPs | overheat/arc | I/V/thermal Open | derating inputs Open | thresholds; OI-PROT |
| `W-FX-POWER-EXTERNAL` | External hazardous energy | Hazardous (external) | From base; distinct | Separate from base | Ext MPs | back-feed/arc | I/V/thermal Open | derating inputs Open | OI-GND-001 |
| `W-FX-RETURN` | Energy return paths | Hazardous (return) | Defined per envelope | Low-impedance defined | current MPs | ground shift | I/thermal Open | — | OI-GND-001 |
| `W-FX-SAFETY` | E-stop/KILL/enable | Signal (safety) | Dedicated, independent | Integrity-monitored | safety-state MPs | loss of inhibit | integrity inputs Open | — | REQ-DCC-V-FX-071 |
| `W-FX-CONTROL` | Command/control | Signal | From power/safety | Noise-controlled | — | wrong command | — | — | — |
| `W-FX-COMMUNICATION` | CAN/service comms | Signal | From power | Impedance-controlled | — | comm loss | — | — | — |
| `W-FX-MEASUREMENT` | Sense/observation | Potential energy/reference/fault path (until qualified) | From power; high-Z; reference-path controlled | Shielded/twisted (class); protection/impedance Open | all MPs | wrong reading; fault-energy carry; unintended reference/back-feed | accuracy/fault-energy/impedance/protection inputs Open | — | OI-SENSE-001; OI-GND-001 |
| `W-FX-SHIELD` | Shielding/reference | Reference | Per GND decision | Per GND decision | — | noise/ground loop | — | — | OI-GND-001 |
| `W-FX-FAULT-INJECTION` | Fault stimulus routing | Conditional | Contained, dedicated | Contained | fault MPs | uncontrolled fault | bounds Open | — | OI-SC-001 |

No conductor size, insulation type, color, or connector is selected.

**Measurement wiring/interface note (WP-015-R1):** `W-FX-MEASUREMENT` and `IF-FX-MEASUREMENT` are **not** classified as unconditionally non-energy. A measurement conductor/instrument input is treated as a potential energy/reference/fault path until its impedance, protection, reference, isolation, and fault behavior are qualified (see `DevKit_Fixture_Measurement_and_DAQ_Architecture.md` §1). No isolation topology is selected (OI-GND-001 Open).

## 3. Operator control and indication (§27)

Preliminary operator controls (request/command only; never sole safety authority):

```text
MASTER FIXTURE ENABLE · BASE AUTH REQUEST · EXTERNAL AUTH REQUEST · ENERGY REMOVE ·
E-STOP · FAULT RESET · RECOVERY CONFIRM · TEST START · TEST ABORT
```

Preliminary indications (presentation; never substitute for physical energy observation):

```text
FIXTURE SAFE · BASE AUTHORIZED · BASE ENERGY OBSERVED · EXTERNAL AUTHORIZED ·
EXTERNAL ENERGY OBSERVED · LOAD BANK ACTIVE · ENERGY REMOVAL ACTIVE ·
DISCHARGE INCOMPLETE · INTERLOCK OPEN · FAULT · LOCKOUT · MEASUREMENT NOT READY
```

Rules:

- `E-STOP` is a safety-effective control, not merely a UI request.
- UI indication shall not substitute for physical energy observation (`ENERGY_PATH_OBSERVED_*`).
- Tablet, web UI, or service PC shall **not** have sole safety authority (PWR-A-024).

## 4. Traceability

REQ-DCC-V-FX-005/010…015/030…034/040/060…062/070/071 · PWR-A-024 · OI-GND-001 · OI-PROT-001/002 · OI-SC-001 · OI-SENSE-001.
